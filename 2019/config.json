The happiest you’ve ever seen a person is when you were <i>18</i> and she walked in on you disassembling the VCR. She loved you and had big dreams for you. You didn’t know exactly what she did for a living, but about five months ago she completely disappeared without a word.</div><br/><div>Today is your <i>20</i>th birthday, and you’re hanging out in your apartment with your roommate, Sam. It’s been a pretty regular morning up until this point except all the electronics in your apartment are on the fritz. Your WiFi enabled toothbrush has been whirling like crazy. Your smart alarm clock keeps beeping and booping. You seriously re-evaluate the merits of your IoT bidet. Everything is a mess.</div><br/><div>“Hey, Sam, did you change anything with the WiFi?”</div><div>“No… oh wait. I found this free ‘Gromecast’ in the parking lot and set it up. It gets free HBO!”</div><br/><div>You walk over to the TV and see a 3D printed Raspberry PI enclosure with a cable going to the TV and another to the router. The enclosure has “Gromecast” and “Free HBO” scrawled on the top in sharpie. You’re going to need to have a talk with Sam after you get this sorted out.</div><br/><div>A quick scan of the port of the device reveal its running <a href=\"telnet://talk-to-me-dd00922915bfc3f1.squarectf.com:5678\">a server</a>.</div>",

On the way to the kitchen, you pass by your digital picture frame. They rotate through pictures of the family vacations you’ve taken: you and your mom at Yosemite, you and your dad hiking in the Alps, you and your family on the Great Wall of China, and just your aunt Matilda with a piña colada on a beach.</div><br/><div>Wait a second. You don’t remember taking that last photo. You would have remembered that last one. How did your aunt’s photo get on there? These picture frames run on SD cards, not WiFi, so the rogue Gromecast shouldn’t have affected it.</div><br/><div>“Hey, Sam. Did you touch the digital picture frames?”</div><div>“No, but can I have my Gromecast back? I want to watch The Leftovers. I hear that show was super underrated.”</div><br/><div>That show was underrated, but now’s not the time. You ignore Sam and pop out the SD card from its digital picture frame to have a look. Sure enough, next to all the photos you added is the new picture of your aunt on a beach along with <a href=\"https://2019.squarectf.com/static/files/8e4274bb0a67535b_aesni.tar.gz\">a binary</a> file.</div>",

Following your nose, you find Sam lounging on the couch, chowing down on a freshly delivered pizza, and jumping to season 2 of <a href=\"https://youtu.be/rLSH-81yT7s\">The Leftovers</a> on the Gromecast. Ugh, how many explanations will this take, but also, when did Sam get pizza?</div><br/><div>“Whatever” you mumble to yourself as you open the box for a hot slice. Season 2 is where the show really steps up. Lifting up the pizza bo<i>x</i> lid, you notice three things: pineapple on the pizza, a cryptic sequence of characters written on the inside of the lid, and a tiny pizza slice-shaped thumb drive.</div><br/><div>“Don’t eat the small slice,” Sam starts. “It’s no good.”</div><br/><div>Upon closer inspection, you notice a few teeth marks on the thumb drive. Yikes. You snap a picture of the inside of the box, pocket the thumb drive, snag two slices, and leave the room right as Justin Theroux’s face pops up on the screen. Any longer, and you’d be stuck in the living room too, re-experiencing that great HBO content.</div><br/><div>You run the pizza box through an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition\">OCR</a> program and get <a href=\"https://2019.squarectf.com/static/files/c6367aef03c0cc0e_decodeme.tar.gz\">the following piece of code as well as the following data on the thumb drive</a>.
